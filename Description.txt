This is a NewLetter website project built using ExpressJS and NodeJS. 

I designed this website to allow users to sign up for a newsletter and receive regular updates on a topic of their choosing. The project uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to separate concerns and improve code organization.

The backend of the project is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, which provide a robust and efficient way to handle server-side logic and routing. The frontend of the project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Some of the key features of this project include:

User authentication and authorization using PassportJS
Database integration with MongoDB using MongooseJS
Email subscription service using Nodemailer
Automatic email generation and sending using NodeJS cron jobs
Admin panel for managing newsletter topics and subscribers
This project is a great example of how to build a web application that can handle email subscriptions and automate the process of sending regular updates. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a great learning resource for developers of all skill levels.

To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using npm. Then, start the server using the command "npm start". You can access the website at http://localhost:3000.
